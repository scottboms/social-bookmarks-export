# README

This script is designed to quickly and easily produce an XML backup of your delicious or Pinboard data in XML format using the (at the moment) common delicious-style API. Backups are automatically saved to a location of your choosing by editing the specified parameters in the script file. Easy. Peasy.

For delicious, you can alternatively export your data to HTML using the standard Export function which can be found here: https://secure.delicious.com/settings/bookmarks/export

This is just easier.

## Changelog

* 1.0 - Initial release
* 1.0.1 - Added Pinboard backup script
