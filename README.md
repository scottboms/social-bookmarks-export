This script is designed to quickly and easily produce an XML backup of your delicious data in XML format using the delicious API. Backups are automatically saved to a location of your choosing by editing the specified parameters in the script file. Easy. Peasy.

Alternatively, you can export your data to HTML using the standard Export function which can be found here: https://secure.delicious.com/settings/bookmarks/export

This is just easier.
